# No runtime dependencies required — this project uses the Python standard library.
# If you later add third-party packages, list them here (one per line), for example:
# pillow==10.0.0    # image handling
# pandas==2.2.2     # dataframes / CSV processing
# numpy==1.27.5     # numeric operations

# To install optional runtime dependencies, uncomment the lines above and run:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
